# Measurement of Vegetation
NDVI: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
(NIR + R)/(NIR + R)

Vegetation Health
< 0 : Inanimate Objects
0.2 – 0.33: Unhealthy plants
0.33 – 0.66: Moderately healthy plants
> 0.66: Very healthy plants

Vegetation Density
0.1 – 0.2: Bare soil
0.2 – 0.5: Sparse Vegetation
> 0.5: Dense vegetation
